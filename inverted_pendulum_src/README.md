Linear_inverted_pendulum.cc.ino is the original source code with chinese comments
Linear_inverted_pendulum.us.ino is the exact same one with translated comments

The code is abolutely abhorrent, no formatting, no naming convention, no coding convention, obvious totologic comments.
I kindly asked chatGPT to fix it up....

Linear_inverted_pendulum.ino final cleaned up state.
