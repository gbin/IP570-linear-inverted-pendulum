# IP570-linear-inverted-pendulum-doc
Easy and accessible spot to get the inverted pendulum documentation IP570 for Arduino. (This is not affiliated with Wheeltec or whoever is building this device)

It can be found on aliexpress as an STM32 or Arduino version. The vendor struggled a lot to share with me the documentation so I share it for the future people
like me that don't want to install a Baidu app on their computers or phones just to download a file.

This is specifically for the Arduino version as a previous dump was done for the STM32 [here](https://github.com/playfultechnology/pid-invertedpendulum)
